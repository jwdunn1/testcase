# FCND - Estimation Project

## Overview

The goal of the project is to develop an estimator to be used by the controller from the previous project to successfully fly a desired flight path using realistic sensors.

## 01 Implementation

### 01.1 Sensor noise

Produced 9.27 seconds of data. Read into Excel. Use STDEV() function to calculate standard deviation of measurements. For GPS, the value is 0.723312 and for IMU, 0.490335. With some adjustments and a capture of 32.57s of data, then GPS: 0.6782  IMU: 0.4955. These are close to the simulated settings of 0.7 for GPU and 0.5 for IMU.

[see lines 3-4 in `06_SensorNoise.txt`]

### 01.2 Attitude estimation

According to Quan, "nonlinear complementary filters are based on a nonlinear relationship between
the angular velocity and the angle of rotation."

To reduce attitude estimation error, first the attitude estimate is converted to a quaternion, then integrated with the Quaternion class function `IntegrateBodyRate()`. Finally, it is converted back to Euler angles using the convenience functions `Roll()`, `Pitch()`, and `Yaw()`.

[see lines 100-109 in `QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp`]

### 01.3 Prediction

Implemented integrate forward, calculate the partial derivative of the body-to-global rotation matrix, and predict the state covariance forward.

[see lines 172-181 in `QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp`]<br>
[see lines 209-219 in `QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp`]<br>
[see lines 266-276 in `QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp`]<br>

Note: in reference paper [2], there is an error in formula 52 on page 9. (I reported this as issue #320 in Waffle.) The code in QuadEstimatorEKF::GetRbgPrime is implemented with the correction (at line 215) to match Diebel[3] equation 71.

### 01.4 Magnetometer update

Implemented `UpdateFromMag` to include the magnetometer data into the state. The solution normalizes the difference between the measured and estimated yaw.

[see lines 328-335 in `QuadEstimatorEKF.cpp`]<br>

### 01.5 GPS update

Implemented GPS update. `hprime` is assigned as an identity matrix as in Diebel[3] equation 55.

## 02 Flight evaluation

### 02.1 Sensor noise

The calculated standard deviation correctly captures ~68% of the sensor measurements.

Unless otherwise noted, results are from tests made with the supplied controller (described as "relaxed to work with an estimated state").

**RESULTS:**

    Simulation #2 (../config/06_SensorNoise.txt)
    PASS: ABS(Quad.GPS.X-Quad.Pos.X) was less than MeasuredStdDev_GPSPosXY for 72% of the time
    PASS: ABS(Quad.IMU.AX-0.000000) was less than MeasuredStdDev_AccelXY for 67% of the time

### 02.2 Attitude estimation

**RESULTS:**

    Simulation #5 (../config/07_AttitudeEstimation.txt)
    PASS: ABS(Quad.Est.E.MaxEuler) was less than 0.100000 for at least 3.000000 seconds

### 02.4 Magnetometer update

Maintain an error of less than 0.1 radians in heading for at least 10 seconds.

**RESULTS:**

    Simulation #3 (../config/10_MagUpdate.txt)
    PASS: ABS(Quad.Est.E.Yaw) was less than 0.100000 for at least 10.000000 seconds
    PASS: ABS(Quad.Est.E.Yaw-0.000000) was less than Quad.Est.S.Yaw for 73% of the time

### 02.5 GPS update

Tuned the GPSPosXYStd and GPSPosZStd values in QuadEstimatorEKF.txt

**RESULTS:**

    Simulation #6 (../config/11_GPSUpdate.txt)
    PASS: ABS(Quad.Est.E.Pos) was less than 1.000000 for at least 20.000000 seconds

![Scenario 11](images/Figure9.png?raw=true)<br>

## 

**NOTE:** Results below are from tests made with the controller from the prior project. (Located in: https://github.com/jwdunn1/FCND-Controls-CPP)<br>

Initial testing using the prior project controller (before tuning) was metrically successful (estimated position error of < 1m), however the aggressive tuning causes the path to overshoot the corners of the box trajectory.

**RESULTS:**

    Simulation #4 (../config/11_GPSUpdate.txt)
    PASS: ABS(Quad.Est.E.Pos) was less than 1.000000 for at least 20.000000 seconds

## 

To mitigate the overshoots, the position and velocity gains were reduced from the more aggressive initial settings until a box shape is achieved.

## 

**NOTE:** The original (more aggressive) controller gains are required for scenarios 3, 4, and 5. Successful passing of these scenarios is not required for this project.
