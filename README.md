## FCND - Motion Planning Project

![A busy drone is a happy drone!](images/skycity.png?raw=true)

### Overview

The goal of the project is to plan a path through an urban environment. The report following consists of 6 sections: starter code, initial implementation, executing test flights, additional functionality, potential optimizations, and references. See also the `motion_planning.py` script for reference.

### 01 Starter Code

The initial version of the `motion_planning.py` script is compared side-by-side with the `backyard_flyer_solution.py` script to briefly describe how each of the implemented modifications is functioning. See Figure 1 below.

### 02 Initial Implementation of the Path Planning Algorithm

**Set global home** by reading the first line of the csv file, extracting lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and using the `self.set_home_position()` method. [at line 396 in `motion_planning.py`]

**Retrieve current position** in geodetic coordinates from `self._latitude`, `self._longitude` and `self._altitude` [at line 400 in `motion_planning.py`].

**Set the start point** as current location [at line 239 in `motion_planning.py`]

**Set the goal point** as any location on the grid [at 244 in `motion_planning.py` See also the options section starting at line 40]. 

**Diagonal motions** added to A* [at line 103 in `planning_utils.py`]. Additional features discussed below.

**Cull waypoints** from the grid paths using a 2D colinearity test [starting at line 244 in `planning_utils.py`]. Grid paths are pruned of excessive points by successively removing the middle point of three if they all fall on the same current line and share the same altitude. When a change in angle is detected, the middle point is retained. The variable `self.cull` enables pruning. (Graph paths are not pruned.) 

## 
### 03 Executing Test Flights

Set the `self.goal` variable to a geodetic coordinate within the city. [See the options section starting at line 40 in `motion_planning.py`]

If the `self.goal` variable is set to `None`, then the program follows an itinerary of 222 coordinates listed in the file `itinerary.csv`. See Figure 2. The flying vehicle visits locations to "make deliveries and pickups". A further option (`self.randomize_itin`) allows for randomization of the itinerary. For test purposes, an option (`self.visit_first`) will ensure an initial visit to the specified index destination (even if randomization is in effect). Note: For itinerary travel, if `n` items are listed in the file, then `n` number of stops will be performed.

**Collider issue:** From the rubric: "At the moment there is some mismatch between the colliders map and actual buildings in the scene." See Figure 3. If a random position is specified, the closest safe landing position is selected from the itinerary. This can be overridden (`self.snap`) at risk of unsafe landings (such as half-way onto a building roof or ledge).

### 04 Additional Functionality and Features

**Grid improvements**<br>
Finding a pathway from some starting positions such as building courtyards proved to be challenging. Two code modifications overcome this: 1) the Grid class operates as a 2.5D model of the terrain, and 2) the A* algorithm accounts for altitude changes as an additional cost. Thus, buildings are considered as obstacles to go over or around, not dead ends. There are some building courtyards where the colliders are not aligned to the building properly, so a larger safety distance may be required for proper departure. However, an increase in safety distance may also complicate targeting of courtyards. A separate grid without safety distance is constructed to determine landing heights.

`CLIMB_COST` controls the cost of altitude changes. Presently set to a value of `100.0`, this is tuned to fly "around" buildings most of the time and to fly "over" only when necessary. A question remains: *What is the energy cost savings to fly around versus over?*

Alternative heuristics functions are available for exploration: euclidean, manhattan, chebyshev, and octile. The octile function is tuned for a lower error estimation, however the Manhattan function is fast and sufficient.

Deadband radius is set to 5 meters for smoother waypoint acquisition.

Heading is calculated between waypoints as `atan2(dy,dx)` where `dy` is the difference in heading east and `dx` in heading north.

When operating with the graph-mode disabled (discussed next) the modified grid A* creates interesting pathways through the city. If the target altitude is higher than the departing altitude, the algorithm will seek increasingly direct routes as it climbs intermediate waypoints along the path.

**Graph overlay option**

- sampled geodetic coordinates at each major road intersection (see Figure 4)
- identified connecting bidirectional edges
- created supporting scripts to determine closest access points to the graph
- modified a copy of A* to operate with graph
- created compound path maker (grid/graph/grid)
- the `self.fly_low` variable enables an altitude drop (to a minimum of 11 meters) while flying along graph edges. If disabled, the vehicle will fly at the altitude of the last departure location.
- if the start and goal location share the same nearest graph node, then a direct route is planned without the graph.
- if the start and goal location are within a distance specified by `GRAPH_THRESHOLD`, then a direct route is planned without the graph. This distance is set at 222 meters (a little more than the diagonal distance of one city block).

**Advantages of the graph**

- less time searching the grid (e.g. a few hundred cycles vs hundreds of thousands)
- higher performance
- road corridors are open and wide (less course corrections)
- avoids back alleys and congested building spaces
- each node "services" an area of the city

**Disadvantages of the graph**

- sometimes the closest node found can cause overshoot backtracking
- taller buildings cause some deeper search (but less than grid-only)
- lower cost routes are possible at higher altitudes

Converted obstacle grid into a class for re-usability. Also modified to store building height data rather than simple binary for a given altitude.

Tested some of the more challenging building courtyards - entrapments - pinchpoint alley-ways where colliders resolution may indicate an embedded area. See Figure 5.<br>

### 05 Potential optimizations

**Edge bisection:** If a target lies between two nodes, an edge which spans the nodes could be split dynamically.<br>
**Acute angle edit:** If a path includes an angle less than 45 degrees, a shorter path may be computed to optimize.<br>
**Edge cross-connection:** When operating at higher altitudes, line-of-sight paths can reduce cost. This could be implemented as a multi-dimensional graph, where shortest paths may be identified at higher altitudes.<br>
**Plan memoization:** Save and reuse previous paths; void with new obstacles.
